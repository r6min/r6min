I'm **Ryan**, a software engineer interested in all things cloud computing, open-source and distributed systems!  

Right now, I'm working on building out cloud infrastructure security at [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) and completing my studies at the University of Waterloo.

I'm looking for internship opportunities for Winter (Jan-Apr) 2021, as well as new grad opportunities in 2021.
